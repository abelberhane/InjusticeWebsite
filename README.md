# InjusticeWebsite
A fun and enjoyable HTML Project that I play with to practice some Basic Web Development.

This isn't a website that focuses on making the best possible Injustice Site, but rather practice my skills and implement new features in C#. It's a work in progress and I plan on evolving this page over time. You can view my progress in the pics below or jump into the code. 

Feel free to contribute, give advice, or just look around.

**Still working on how to properly pull and merge. Each Update requires a Force push and it resets the commits each time.

New Things I have learned while making this specific site:
1) Using iframes
2) Using bootsrap themes and page responsiveness
3) Manipulating line breaks for addresses
4) Troubleshooting CSS

Goals to Add on: 8/4/17
1) Additional margin spacing inbetween Contacts Page Map and Words
2) Images for the Fighters Page
3) RSS Twitter feed by the nav bar of the Injustice Page
4) Content wrap the site so I can have black Sides similar to www.geektyrant.com
