# InjusticeWebsite
A fun and enjoyable HTML Project that I play with to practice some Basic Web Development.

This isn't a website that focuses on making the best possible Injustice Site, but rather practice my skills and implement new features in C#. It's a work in progress and I plan on evolving this page over time. You can view my progress in the pics below or jump into the code. 

Feel free to contribute, give advice, or just look around.
